# quiz
This assignment has been really hard for me to finish. I think it is a combination of low motivation and knowledge on some of the things. I will get help for it.
this quiz is supposed to run when you press the start button. it is a timed multiple choice java script quiz! the user WILL get docked time when they get a question wrong. at the end of the quiz they can put there name in the highscore section and will be able to see it the next time they go on the website.
